# Launch-Checklist-Form



Hi and welcome to my site that was created as an assignment for the LaunchCode cirriculum.

https://kyebrowning.github.io/Launch-Checklist-Form/

The keys to this assignment were to use the DOM and read data from a JSON file. I also added a function to randomize the planet you will visit each mission, so if you don't like the planet you're going to feel free to refresh the page. 

Thanks for taking a stop by and checking out the site.
